# image-classification-model
image classification model is designed to classify weather an image is fake or real
please note that this image classification model is still in development and is not fully optimized as  a result of this it may produce insufficient and sometimes the wrong results.
Limitations:
Insufficient Training Data: The model may not have seen enough examples of certain classes during training.
Image Quality: Low-resolution images, heavy noise, or significant alterations in image content may affect performance.
Class Imbalance: If one class is overrepresented in the training data, the model may favor that class over others.
